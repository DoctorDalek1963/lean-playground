# Lean Playground

This folder is a kind of scratch space for me to play with Lean 4 and mathlib. It is entirely meant to be used interactively with [my nvim config](https://github.com/DoctorDalek1963/nixvim-config), so I don't know if the lake infrastructure actually works properly. I'm only using lake to provide mathlib for interactive use.
